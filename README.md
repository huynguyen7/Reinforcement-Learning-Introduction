# REINFORCEMENT-LEARNING ALGORITHMS
This repository contains examples for Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:
- Single-state K-bandits (Basic Monte Carlo with sampling average).
- Gridworld MDP (Estimating state values with Bellman Equation).
- Gridworld Policy Iteration (Using Policy Iteration to estimate state values for optimal policies)
- Gambler Problem (Using value iteration DP to estimate state values for optimal policies).
- Blackjack (Using MC Prediction to estimate state values, also using Model-Free MC Control to estimate optimal policies)
